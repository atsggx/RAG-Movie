# Maniac: Movie Q&A RAG
Our project aims to create a Python-based movie question-answering assistant. The core functionality involves enabling users to ask questions about a movie. The system will then use a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach to search the relevant text and generate a concise answer, effectively providing information extracted from the dataset. The output will be a brief and informative response to the user's query.
